# webhook-sender
a simple thing I made to send webhooks via python

How to use

1. Download python: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe (WHEN INSTALLING MAKE SURE TO ADD TO PATH)
2. Enter the current directory
3. type in the command python -m pip install requirements.txt
4. Enter your webhook in the .env file
5. run the python file and you should be ok
